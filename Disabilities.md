###OpenBionics - prosthetic arm

The proposal of OpenBionics consist in the creation of affordable prosthetic arms for everyone (being less than 200 euros) easy to manufacture, they can be created using off-the-shelf products (in any hardware strore) and with the use of a 3D printer.

The CAD files (Computer-aided design) are also available, (the ".stl" format is the one used to define the geometry of 3D objects) in which come defined the pieces for right and left hands.

###OptiKey

OptiKey is an assistive on-screen keyboard which runs on Windows. It is designed to be used with an eye-tracking device to assist with keyboard and mouse control for those living with motor and speech limitations, such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) / Motor Neuron Disease (MND).

It works out of the box once you have your eye-tracking device installed and allows selections to be made using dwell selection, buttons, etc. If you do not have an eye tracking device, OptiKey can be used with a mouse.

OptiKey was written as an accessible alternative to the outrageously expensive, unreliable and difficult to use AAC (alternative and augmentative communication) products currently on the market. It is, therefore, fully open-source and free. Forever.
